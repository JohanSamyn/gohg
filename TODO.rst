Use the stats.py example from the python-hglib tool for testing.
That can be a simple means of being able to verify the output
by comparing the results of both gohg and python-hglib.

Maybe we can even manage multiple connections ?
Question: can we manage more than 1 repo from the same Hg Command Server
instance ? If not then I don't think multiple connections will work.
