gohg - a Go client library for Mercurial
*****************************************

This project aims at creating a Go client library for the Mercurial dvcs,
using it's Command Server for better performance.

It's second purpose - by no means less then the first one - is to have a real
project for working with the Go language, which is very appealing to me.

So don't expect anything to be ready quickly, cause this will be a learning
process.
